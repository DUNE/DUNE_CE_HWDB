### CHECKOUT RECEPTION TESTS ###
# The results of the *bare* PCB visual inspection are in 
# "PTC PCB Inspection Bare.xlsx"
# This is done once for each batch of PCBs upon reception.
# The results of the *assembled* PCB visual inspection are in 
# "PTC PCB Inspection Assy.xlsx"
# Note: front panels are not individually tracked as part of QC

### QC TESTS (ONE REPORT PER PTC) ###
# An image of the PTC is "assembled_pcb_004.png" in this directory
PTC_VISUAL: PASS
PTC_SERIAL: 004

# The following measurements are manually performed with DVM or oscilloscope.
# In the future, we will have a test scripts that prompts the tester for the 
# measurement, and automatically generates this file.
