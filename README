https://dune.github.io/computing-HWDB/setup.html

If you have obtained the tokens, modify the setup_hwdb.sh file with the location of the bearer token.
The choice of the "Production" or the "Developer" version is set by providing "PROD" or "DEV" in the
respective variable. Furthermore, the verbocity environmetal variable can take values "VERB0" and "VERB1".

source setup_hwdb.sh

source clean_repo.sh
