In order to us the library one needs to obtain tokens following the steps here:
https://dune.github.io/computing-HWDB/setup.html

If you have obtained the tokens, modify the setup_hwdb.sh file with the location of the bearer token and then run:
source setup_hwdb.sh

If you are a developer and would like to push chnages to the git repository please run:
source clean_repo.sh

The library dune_ce_hwdb.py contains the core REST API functions.
Sample user functions are included and can be run using python3
